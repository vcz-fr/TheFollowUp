    <h1>For when a tweet is just not enough</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, Vincenzo <b>Scalzi</b> here!
    </p>
    <p>
        The world is wonderful. So many places for your mind to wander around. So many ideas to explore. So many
        thoughts to traverse one's head. We are billions and we produce such an amount of knowledge, passion, ideas. A
        portion of which ends up on the Internet and will get discovered, shared and improved upon. This website aims to
        become my own curated trove of discoveries. Articles, snippets, ideas and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
        At times, <a href="https://twitter.com/vcz_fr" rel="nofollow"></a>140 or 280 characters</a> bring just not
        enough context. Explaining why a content deserves your attention can take longer. It may be because it deals
        with a topic I am attached to or because it demonstrates progress, a vision years in the making, years into the
        future. The future we are building, one idea at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Introducing <strong>The FollowUp</strong> with an age-old pledge: a fast and reliable experience with no
        tracking on my side. Ever.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for this site, like my others, it is open source, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/"
            rel="nofollow">GitHub Pages</a>, uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> to generate
        content and is delivered to you by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        That way, there is no server to manage, no hosting costs or headaches, just a domain. Just a domain with free
        content you will appreciate. I can only hope you will like it as I will never add any third party comment tool
        or analytics. If you do enjoy the contents, come by <a href="https://github.com/vcz-fr/TheFollowup"
            rel="nofollow">the place that hosts it</a> and leave your mark. Or check out my <a
            href="https://vcz.fr">personal website</a>, my <a href="https://meetups.vcz.fr">Meetup notes</a>, my <a
            href="https://blog.vcz.fr">blog</a> or my <a href="https://apps.vcz.fr">apps</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not forget to <a href="https://apps.vcz.fr/feedback/?appid=hS7YejNaDu6k">leave some feedback</a> so that I
        can make your experience better.

        Back to you now!
