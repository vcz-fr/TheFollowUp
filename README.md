# The FollowUp

A blink to the Past!

## The motivation

The world is wonderful. So many places for your mind to wander around. So many ideas to explore. So many thoughts to
traverse one's head. We are billions and we produce such an amount of knowledge, passion, ideas. A portion of which ends
up on the Internet and will get discovered, shared and improved upon. This website aims to become my own curated trove
of discoveries. Articles, snippets, ideas and much more.

At times, 140 or 280 characters bring just not enough context. Explaining why a content deserves your attention can take
longer. It may be because it deals with a topic I am attached to or because it demonstrates progress, a vision years in
the making, years into the future. The future we are building, one idea at a time.

Introducing **The FollowUp** with an age-old pledge: a fast and reliable experience with no tracking on my side. Ever.

Back to you now!
