## Additional information

Most of this keynote was centered around performance:

- Deep learning improvements made Natural Language Processing possible in real time to power the new generation of
  Google Assistant;
- Google Allo could understand intents to help small businesses take appointments or support customers automatically
  through the phone;
- Firebase gets more features for developers to power their applications and even gets a free plan;
- Finally Android N which greatly improves upon its predecessors in terms of performance, privacy and security.

A month later, we learned that the official desert name for Android N was "Nougat".
