## Update from the 26th of November 2021

What is fascinating about this mod is that it has been released for free while it cost money and time to develop. Edmund
McMillen, creator of the original game was not aware of this mod until its release.

After its release, both development teams and Nicalis, the studio that developed the fully fledged versions of the game
and mods, started collaborating on an official inclusion of Antibirth's ideas into the main game as the latest DLC [Repentance](https://www.nicalis.com/games/thebindingofisaacrepentance).
