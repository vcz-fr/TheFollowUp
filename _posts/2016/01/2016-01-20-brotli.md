tweet: "The new compression algorithm for a faster Web"
---

## Update from the 26th of November 2021

Brotli has been extremely successful thanks to its implementation in the woff2 font format to encode the glyph
information. At similar compression levels, Brotli can compress much faster which is a boon when serving large amounts
of text contents such as APIs or just Web experiences. Note that assets such as CSS and JavaScript scripts can be
pre-compressed to avoid the latency increase, CPU usage and suboptimal experience of on the fly brotli compression.

If you can set it up on your servers, please do.
