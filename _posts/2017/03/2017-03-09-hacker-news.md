## Update from the 26th of November 2021

I am still reading articles and discovering new ideas today. I absolutely love this website and what it brought to the
community and it got me into writing thanks to the amazing community and moderation. I cannot stress this enough: you
will learn new things every day, you will pickup new words, even learn the existence of a thing or two.

This place will always have a special spot in my heat.
