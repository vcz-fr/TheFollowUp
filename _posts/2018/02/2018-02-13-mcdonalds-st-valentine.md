## Update from the 15th of January 2023

Yuck. Hopefully I did not write that tweet. It's a fake attempt at their contest where you had to submit a love
declaration to their Big Mac. The prize was a $10k Big Mac ring. You can't deny that the idea is original! And you know
what? I'm loving it!

Sorry, I'm so sorry...
