## Update from the 15th of January 2023

For those wondering, this practice is called [Domain parking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_parking){:rel="nofollow"}
and is typically used to forge a fake version of the official website to phish users while simultaneously ransoming the
legitimate website author. Such an act is called [cybersquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting){:rel="nofollow"}.

There is balance to be found between spending consequential amounts of money to prevent this threat from happening and
the financial and reputational damage that it would cause. If you believe you are a victim of such abuse, get in touch
with an expert and with competent authorities.
