## Update from the 15th of January 2023

This project has seen its last issue in 2021. Stripe discontinued it and it brought us a collection of 19
well-illustrated and edited issues. I encourage you to read it, even acquire it if you are an offline reader like me.

For those who possess the physical edition, here is a secret: the red space on the spine of each issue represents the
GDP of the internet at the time of release. ([source](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1569348493126569984){:rel="nofollow"})
