tweet: "Is it time for borderless phones?"

## Update from the 15th of January 2023

Well... yes and no. I purchased my current smartphone in the beginning of May 2019. It is a OnePlus 7 Pro and I am still
enjoying its use. It recently received its last Android update and I will start flashing it whenever I'll feel like it.

I really wanted to see more borderless phones. I almost never use that frontal camera and I like not having it facing me
all the time, yet I must admit that the mechanics required for it to be hidden are complex. For mass-produced devices,
you really want to bring down complexity and this is the exact opposite.

Even the underscreen camera idea didn't take off: the technology simply isn't there. It's been more than three years and
I have no hope of seeing it anytime soon. There is no demand.

At least, this gives me reason enough to keep my phone alive for as long as I possibly can.
