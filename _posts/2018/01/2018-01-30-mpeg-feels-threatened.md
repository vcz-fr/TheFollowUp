tweet: "The founder and chairman of MPEG feels threatened by the Alliance for Open Media"

## Update from the 10th of July 2022

Well you know what, they should be. The [Alliance for Open Media](https://aomedia.org/){:rel="nofollow"} uses a far
saner patent approach. Even though their solutions are not as entrenched into silicon as MPEG properties, they proved to
be more efficient both in video with [AV1](https://aomedia.org/av1/){:rel="nofollow"} and in still pictures with AVIF.

In a way, good riddance to them, their royalty model and their patent pool system that makes any innovation practically
impossible unless you got big pockets. Here's to hoping for more competition in that space. An of course, let's raise
our glasses to the companies on board with AOM, the ones that implemented the reference tools and browser support. AVIF
is an exceptionally versatile image format even if it does not consistently beat webp.
