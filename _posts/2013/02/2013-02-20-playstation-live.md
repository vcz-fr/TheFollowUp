## Additional information

During this PlayStation 4 live event, Sony announced that their new console would boast 8GB of RAM, a disk drive, a new
low-latency controller. Highlights on the controller itself: it has lights that can be used to color-code players,
support for jack 3.5mm and a "Share" button.

That is not all because the new console OS would allow to play games while they are still downloading! It would also
significantly reduce save and load times.

The PlayStation 4 is a social console: the "Share" button is for screenshots, in-game footage, streaming, etc. That is
how you form durable gaming communities.
