## Update from the 6th of June 2021

The face of the Web changed in 2015. Developers and organizations from all horizons joined handsand started using this
service right away. The adoption over the following weeks that more actors began relying on their services and making
them a standard. With a simple and reliable API integrated to many existing solutions and even a CLI, the adoption has
been immediate.

Thanks to this service, Web Browser vendors started changing the state of the Web and pushed for features reserved to
secure-only connections like HTTP/2[^1] and HTTP/3, many newer JavaScript APIs, etc. This also ended the reign of
Extended Validation certificates as browsers phased out displaying the name of the certificate holder, which also
contributed to simplifying the experience for Web users.

Clearly, this technology and the actors behind it revolutionized the Web. I am extremely thankful that they did. If you
use their services too, please check out [their website](https://letsencrypt.org/){:rel="nofollow"} and donate or ask
your company to join the sponsors.

Personally, I would love for this initiative to succeed and to advance the state of the platform. They have ambitious
projects too: including [Prio Services](https://www.abetterinternet.org/prio/){:rel="nofollow"} and making core Web
components memory-safe.

[^1]: HTTP/2 can technically work with insecure connections but no mainstream browser allows this behavior.
