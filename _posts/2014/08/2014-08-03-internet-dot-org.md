## Additional information

Do you own research, of course. It appears that this project was set out to bring Internet connectivity to new
communities. In the grand scheme of things, this is part of Facebook's strategy "we reached a billion users, how to
reach the next billion?". Hard it is to progress when there is a conflict of interest this large with branching side
debates such as net neutrality.

The story did not end well with several companies and individuals criticizing the direction the project was taking,
partners leaving, regulation being harsh. But that does not mean it is not serving users right today. I cannot speak for
the persons using the current version of this project -as of May of 2021- but I hope they are well and that they can get
the most out of it.
