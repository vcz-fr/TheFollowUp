While I am against Google Analytics and tools of the like, I must admit that seeing people react positively to content 
motivated me to share more. That sort of engagement to the platform certainly was Twitter's objective. In the case of 
this website, I use general trends such as network bandwidth, number of unque visitors, etc. It is not perfect nor 
precise but it keeps motivation up!
