If you are a passionate gamer or want to see your childhood games get raced through extremely fast, then be sure to 
check out their events and replays on their [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick){:rel="nofollow"}. On 
a lighter note, I recommend their Secret of Mana video of this edition and any [I Wanna Be The Boshy](https://www.grynsoft.com/index){:rel="nofollow"} 
play by [witwix](https://www.twitch.tv/witwix/){:rel="nofollow"} you can find!

A shoutout to the community of viewers, who donated over $700k this year, that is way over the donation objective of 
$500k. Congratulations everyone!
