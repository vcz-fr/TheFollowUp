## Additional information

Doesn't it seem crazy how technology evolved over the last decades? Not the personal transportation industry, this
hoverboard is obviously an impossible feat of engineering. I am talking about the cinema and the virtual effects
industry. How clearing objects and making people believe the impossible. This also has its downsides, see the history of [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com/){:rel="nofollow"}
for reference.
