## Update from the 17th of May 2021

Well yes, but actually no. Phonebloks was way ahead of its time. The ambition was big: creating a phone with reusable
and swappable components just like Lego blocks! And it gained traction very fast. The creator of the project created a
campaign on a Kickstarter-like website called [Thunderclap](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/2931-phonebloks/){:rel="nofollow"}
to measure the potential audience that would be interested and it still is the biggest campaign on that platform by far.

Seeing that support, companies gained interest in that idea. Examples include the [LG G5](https://www.lg.com/us/cell-phones/lg-RS988-Silver-g5-unlocked){:rel="nofollow"}
and much later Essential with the PH-1, if you count the camera module. Google took the lead of Phonebloks with Project
Ara.

Ara was ambitious too in its own regard. In fact even more than Phonebloks: a version of Android Lollipop was about to
be created specifically for modular phones that could allow hot-swapping non-critical components! Still, even the
backing from a behemoth of a company could not save it as there were major flaws with the design: there was no way to
guarantee an IP rating on such a phone with all the connectors exposed. Get some water between the points of contact of
your components and you may fry them. Remember you have to transfer data and power in and out of your components, some
of them having wildly different expectations for both.

While this project in particular and its reincarnations are dead, the idea of a mainstram modular device still floats
around. Who knows, someone might find the solution one day. Until then.
