Well yes, but actually no. Phonebloks was way ahead of its time. The ambition was big: creating a phone which components
are reusable and swappable, just like Lego blocks! And it gained traction very fast. The creator of the project created
a campaign on a Kickstarter-like product called [Thunderclap](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/2931-phonebloks/){:rel="nofollow"}
to measure the potential audience that would be interested and it is still the biggest campaign of that platform and by
far.

Seeing that support, companies started looking into modular phones. Examples include LG with their [G5](https://www.lg.com/us/cell-phones/lg-RS988-Silver-g5-unlocked){:rel="nofollow"}
and much later Essential with the PH-1, if you count the camera module. Google took the lead of this one though, with
Project Ara.

Ara was ambitious too in its own regard. In fact even more than Phoneblocks: a version of Andoid Lollipop was about to
be created specifically for modular phones that could allow hot-swapping non-critical components! Still, even the
backing from a behemoth of a company could not save it as there were major flaws with the design: there was no way to
guarantee an IP rating on such a phone with all the connectors exposed. Get some water between the points of contact of
your components and you may fry them. Remember you have to transfer data and power in and out of your components, some
of them having wildly different expectations for both.

While this project in particular and mots of its simpler reincarnations are dead, the idea of a mainstram modular device
still floats around. Who knows, someone might find the solution one day. Until then.
