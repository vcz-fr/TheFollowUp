## Update from the 26th of November 2021

Let's Encrypt has significantly changed the shape of the Web. The vast majority of Web communication is now encrypted,
certificate issual came back in the hands of development teams, Web protocols and API improvements relying on secure
connections could reach the masses.

Let's Encrypt made not only the Web safer but also faster: we can now establish SSL connections on TLS 1.3 using 0-RTT
with ED25519 certificate chains. Some browsers will even start negotiating before you access the site based on what they
infer you are going to access next.
