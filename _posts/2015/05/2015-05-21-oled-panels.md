## Update from the 1st of August 2021

OLED took off fast and made it to phones, smartwatches, monitors and even game consoles with the PlayStation Vita or the
new OLED Nintendo Switch. It turns out that the flexibility was also a factor in a design trend of curved screens and
devices. I purchased one of those high-end devices and... I am not a fan of the trend as it caused many unwanted taps
and swipes. However the tech is sweet.

It also sparked another revolution in terms of content quality: now that blacks are as deep as the screen allows,
contrast becomes essentially infinite. This also means that we need new video and image formats to describe these
contrasts in pictures. And thus we got HDR, _High Dynamic Range_.

But OLED is not all good: auto-emissive screens are not the brightest and organic LEDs tend to keep their state when
displaying the same content for too long. This is called "burn-in" and can damage your screen. Solutions had to be
developed to minimize burn-in at the hardware and software level. Plus, even years after their mass production, OLED is
still relatively expensive. If you think that, just wait for the next display technology.
