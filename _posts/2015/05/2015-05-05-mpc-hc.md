## Update from the 1st of August 2021

The last update of MPC-HC has been released in July of 2017 after 11 years of development. The reason is an issue that
cannot easily be avoided: the lack of contributors. Open source moves forward thanks to the passion of many developers
working in their spare time. Open source is not just contributing code, it is maintaining a community, a product.

Some projects falter because of a lack of funding, others because of a lack of contributors. Some critical projects
almost died or were transferred to ill-intentioned maintainers.

Open source is hard.
