## Update from the 1st of August 2021

When I was a moderator for the community of a French Flash game portal which developed a successful game later on, I
often had to check obfuscated links for content against the terms of service. At some point, the number of links to
check grew and bad actors made it clear that all links had to be checked and even detected.

I developed two tools: Unlink, to resolve all the redirection for a given URL and a [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/){:rel="nofollow"}
script to detect and pass links to unlink then edit the DOM to notify the user of the links on the page. Plus other
features to make my life easier.

Behind the scenes, it started with a simple PHP script doing HEAD requests until one of these situations:
- The URL is invalid;
- The URL has been seen previously;
- Too many redirections;
- A URL responded with something other than a redirection.

A few months ago, I felt like my hosting provider was playing reliability tricks on me and was costing me too much for
the service so I decided to rewrite this service in NodeJS on Cloudflare functions, since I am using it as my go-to CDN
and I will never look back: there are less lines of code to maintain, the service is hosted for free and has been
reliable for a while now.
