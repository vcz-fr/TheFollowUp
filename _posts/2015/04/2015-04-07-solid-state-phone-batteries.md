## Update from the 1st of August 2021

There have been so many battery announcements over the years. Research has always been wild and experimental results are
all over the place, yet no breakthrough has truly entered production. There are reasons for that:
- Lithium ion batteries are still the state of the art for consumer devices in terms of manufacturing scalability,
  manufacturing costs, safety -even though that is very relative-, storage density, output, longevity, etc. Nothing has
  come close of beating all of these metrics yet;
- Lithium ion has been and is still being extensively reasearched and mass-produced, thus making it harder for other
  technologies to break through;
- There are other sorts of batteries on the market for niches. High yields are sometimes not as important as energy
  density. High output might not matter when you power extremely energy efficient devices.

Do not get fooled, everyone will know when new battery tech hits the market, especially now that more demanding devices
are on the shelves or rather on the roads.
