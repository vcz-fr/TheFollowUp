## Update from the 1st of August 2021

The equipment replaces the cheapest -as in inexpensive and non-qualitative- equipment to date, the Freebox Crystal. It
supports ADSL, VDSL or fiber connections, 4K IPTV and uses Android TV for the low price of 29.99â‚¬ per month. The TV
remote can use voice control to help you find your favorite shows. Clearly, that is a good deal.
